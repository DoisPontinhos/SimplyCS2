# SimplyCS2

This is a very small config I tried to make mixing Horizong cfg and CSAFAP cfg into one

**Desubticked Binds**
  - JumpThrow Bind included (Hold Smoke with `mouse1` and then fast press `ALT`)

**Null Binds aka SnapTap**
  - I tried to make Null binds and desubticked (Not sure it desubtick is working)
